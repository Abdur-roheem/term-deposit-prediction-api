# 🚀 Term Deposit Subscription Prediction API  

## 📌 Overview  
This project builds and deploys a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on historical marketing data.  

It demonstrates an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** from data exploration and model training to deployment as a REST API—designed to support **data-driven business decision-making**.


## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Marketing campaigns often target a broad audience, leading to **low conversion rates and wasted resources**.  

This project aims to:
- Identify customers most likely to subscribe  
- Improve targeting efficiency  
- Reduce operational and marketing costs  


## 💡 Solution  
A classification model was developed using Python and deployed as an API that allows real-time predictions based on customer data.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **pandas, NumPy**  
- **scikit-learn**  
- **FastAPI**  
- **Uvicorn**  
- **Docker**  


## 📊 Model Performance  
- **ROC-AUC Score:** `0.92`  
- Demonstrates strong ability to distinguish between subscribing and non-subscribing customers  


## 🔍 Approach  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature engineering and encoding  

### 2. Model Development  
- Trained classification models using `scikit-learn`  
- Evaluated using ROC-AUC and other metrics  
- Selected best-performing model  

### 3. Deployment  
- Model saved using `pickle`  
- Exposed via REST API using FastAPI  
- Containerised using Docker for reproducibility
